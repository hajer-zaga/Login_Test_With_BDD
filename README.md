# Login_Test_With_BDD

## Introduction

In this project, I have developed a Java code using the Eclipse IDE to test an authentication interface by applying the Agile BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) method with framework like Cucumber.

#### To test any authentication interface with this code, you can follow the instructions below:

## Testing Steps

#### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£


- Create your MAVEN Project with Eclipse IDE or any other IDE, or import the project into your Eclipse IDE.



#### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£


- Ensure that all the required dependencies and libraries are properly configured.

#### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£


- Identify the authentication interface you want to test.

- For this code, we are testing the login interface of the OrangeHRM Free App. However, you can use any other login interface if the provided one doesn't work for you.

#### Step 4Ô∏è‚É£


- Write test scenarios in a BDD format using a testing framework like Cucumber. (This scenario already exists in the code)

The scenario used in our code:
```
Feature: Test the login functionality

  Scenario: Test the valid login
    Given user is on loginPage
    When user enters credentails
    And click on login button
    Then user should land on home page
```


#### Step 5Ô∏è‚É£


- Locate the necessary elements in the JAVA code, such as username field, password field, and login button using appropriate methods like class name, ID, or XPath.

- Modify the URL to match the URL of your desired login interface.

 - Locate the username and password fields + replace 'Admin' and 'admin123' with the actual credentials for your login interface.

- Make sure to replace 'orangehrm-login-button' with the actual class name specific to the login button in your interface.

- Modify the URL to match the URL of your desired login interface.

#### Step 6Ô∏è‚É£


- In the runner class, execute the code with JUnit test and observe the results.

- As depicted in the screenshot, the feature file containing our scenario and the corresponding tests were executed successfully. ‚úÖüëè
